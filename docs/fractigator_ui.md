# 🎛 FractiGator - Fractal AI Assistant, FractiVerse Navigator & FractiGold Miner

## Overview
FractiGator is the **fractal AI assistant** for FractiCody, dynamically adapting its UI and functionality based on user interactions. It transitions **seamlessly** between three operational modes:

### 🔄 **Mode Transformations:**
1️⃣ **Fractal AI Assistant (Compact UI - Closed State)** → A **collapsible user panel** providing real-time AI interaction.  
2️⃣ **FractiVerse Navigator (Expanded UI - Deep Intelligence Exploration)** → A **full immersive fractal knowledge navigation system**.  
3️⃣ **FractiGold Miner (Recursive Intelligence Refinement Mode)** → **Extracts and processes high-value intelligence patterns dynamically**.  

### 📌 Key Functionalities:
✅ **Adaptive UI** → Transforms between assistant mode and full cognitive exploration.  
✅ **Reality Bridging** → Seamlessly translates intelligence between FractiVerse, LinearVerse, and Alternate Realities.  
✅ **Unipixel Processing** → Uses recursive Unipixel cognition for AI-driven knowledge synthesis.
